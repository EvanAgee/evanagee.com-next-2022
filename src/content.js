  I've been developing web apps professionally since 2000 (Geocities anyone?). In that span of time I've worked
  with agencies and clients all over the world.
  <strong>
    I've built applications with the likes of Gateway Church, Carb Manager, Facebook, Disney, PeiWei, Bethel Church, Hillsong Church and Koch Industries.
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy
  developing JavaScript-based projects, especially using React or Vue. In addition to my client work I'm also creator and maintainer of the
  <a href="https://github.com/EvanAgee/vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Vuejs Wordpress Starter Theme
  </a>
  and I'm the founder of <a href="https://vuewp.com" target="_blank">vuewp.com</a> a training platform for those interested in
  the WordPress + Vue ecosystem.
